                            <p>This document is incorporated by reference into the Subscription Agreement for Software as a
                                Service entered into between Gray Quarter, Inc. ("Gray Quarter") and Customer.</p>
                            <p>Hosted Service monitoring occurs twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, and
                                three-hundred sixty-five (365) days per year. Gray Quarter will use its best efforts and
                                commercially reasonable standards to meet a target availability service level of ninety-nine
                                and one-half percent (99.50%) for Hosted Service (in production environment) of the term
                                noted in the Subscription Agreement for Software as a Service.</p>
                            <p>In the event technical support is required by Customer regarding Hosted Service, Gray Quarter
                                will provide support to Customer (“Technical Support”) for Hosted Service during Gray Quarter's
                                normal business hours defined as Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard
                                Time. After hours support for critical issues that cannot wait to be requested and addressed
                                until the next business day may be provided through the Gray Quarter After Hours Technical
                                Support phone number (925) 236 0070, or via email at: support@grayquarter.com</P>
                            <p>Customer may make Technical Support requests by contacting Gray Quarter electronically or telephoning
                                Gray Quarter’s Technical Support staff. Customer will provide the requestor’s name, Customer
                                name (organization/entity), and a detailed description of the issue. The Technical Support
                                staff shall assign to the request the Problem Severity Level as determined by Gray Quarter.
                                Customer must provide Gray Quarter with the contact information for employees who will be
                                available outside of Customer’s normal business hours, if any, should Technical Support be
                                provided during that time. Gray Quarter will use its best efforts and commercially reasonable
                                standards and protocol to respond to Customer’s support problems within twenty-four (24)
                                hours from Customer's initial Technical Support request.</p>
                            <p>If, during the Technical Support request, Gray Quarter determines within its sole discretion
                                that the Technical Support request warrants a higher or lower priority level response, the
                                Technical Support request will be upgraded or downgraded to the priority level that most
                                appropriately reflects the issues experienced by Customer with Hosted Service.</p>
                            <p>Gray Quarter may use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve each significant issue by providing
                                a Workaround, a code patch or a specific action plan for how Gray Quarter will address the
                                issue for the benefit of Customer. “Workaround” means a change in the procedures followed
                                or that Customer supplies to avoid a problem in the environment of Hosted Service without
                                substantially impairing Customer’s use of the Hosted Service. A Workaround may be either
                                temporary or permanent in nature.</p>
                            <p>Service fees may apply to any requests outside of normal support services. These services will
                                be provided on a time and material basis at Gray Quarter’s then-current hourly rate.</p>
                            <p>For new releases of the Hosted Service, Customer and Gray Quarter will work together to define
                                upgrade requirements and protocols and timelines so that Customer realizes little downtime
                                to Hosted service while the environment and customizations to the new version of Hosted Service
                                are being implemented.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy or in the Subscription Agreement for
                                Software as a Service or any Quote or SOW, in no event, with respect to the Hosted Service,
                                shall any service unavailability or failure to meet any service availability objectives or
                                parameters under this Policy be deemed to be or constitute a breach by Gray Quarter of this
                                Policy, the Subscription Agreement for Software as a Service, or Quote or SOW. Customer’s
                                right to terminate provided in the Subscription Agreement for Software as a Service shall
                                be Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy at law or in equity on account of any failure to
                                meet any service availability objectives or parameters set forth in this Policy.</p>
